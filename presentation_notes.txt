            - Struggles
                - Could not compare dates at first
                    - When user inputted a date, we did it so it would record in the database as "Thursday, May something, 2019" ... but when trying to compare the dates, it would just compare the weekday and then wouldn't look at the rest ..
                    - So left it alone and didn't add a datetime string parse time filter ...
                - Had to create an template filter to change how it's displayed in the html
                    - And so it worked! because then it would compare the year, then the month, then the day ... and then the filter helped display it how we were trying to do the first time as "Thursday, May something, 2019"
